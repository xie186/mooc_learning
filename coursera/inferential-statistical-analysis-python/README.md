## Week 2


### Conservative Approch & Sample Size Consideration

95% Confidence intervals for $$p$$

Estimated stardard error: 

$$
\hat{p} \pm 1.96\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}
$$

Estimated stardard error:

$$
\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}
$$

which is maximized when $\hat{p}$=0.5. 

**Conservative standard error** = $\frac{1}{2\sqrt{n}}$


$\hat{p} \pm 2\frac{1}{2\sqrt{n}}$

$\hat{p} \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$

95% margin of error is only dependent on sample size. 

Conservative 95% confidence interval.

Margin of Error (MoE) is only dependent on:

1) out confidence level (typically 95%)

2) out sample size

Sample size determination 

Summary: 

* Estimated stardard error may be too small, or inaccurate based off sample so can employ conservative approch. 

* Conservative approch -> determine sample size needed based on a conridence level and edsired margin of error.
